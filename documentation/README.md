* [uniswap docs](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/)
* [Synthetix contracts](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix)

#### Bad
* [Hegic, some contracts are well commented, some are not, for example, the bonding curve contracts are badly done, but some options are well done](https://github.com/hegic/initial-bonding-curve-offering/blob/master/contracts/InitialOffering/HegicInitialOffering.sol)
* [Sushiswap :o Quite a few contracts do not include natspec](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/tree/master/contracts)
